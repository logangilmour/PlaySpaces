Welcome to PlaySpaces!

DEPLOYING
=========

There are no special steps required to deploy this application.
To start the application, simply open public/index.html in your web browser by 
double-clicking on the document from your file explorer.  The application
requires JavaScript to be enabled in your browser.

Please note that due to local content access policies, some features such as
audio and video may not work properly when viewing the application on your
local file system.  To ensure correct operation, it is best to deploy the
public directory to an accessible location on a web server and then navigate
to the app over HTTP.  However, you needn't go through these steps yourself;
you can view the app online at:

USING
=====

An iPad or Android tablet is recommended for the optimal experience.

The app will start on the PlaySpaces splash screen.  Simply tap or click
to continue.  Then, tap or click on dots and camera icons to interact
with them.  If you would like audio content to be repeated after it is
initially played, just hold down the associated dot.
